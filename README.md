# moneybotccselfleak

Recently there have been allegations of a moneybot source leak. These are older sources from early 2018/2019 (csgo/tf2/gmod/old loader), which were coded as a learning project by Nave and his friends back when he was the owner of moneybot. 

Since people want to "flex" and act special because they have access to a old source, we have decided to release these sources to the public in order to prevent others being scammed should these people try to paste or sell a source/hack made from the leak. 

None of these sources are from the current ownership/development team of moneybot and nothing from these leaked sources will be included in the upcoming recode of moneybot.cash. While we didn't address this sooner because we simply didn't care much, we realize that eventually as it spread people would start asking questions and act out of hand, so enjoy the sources here.
